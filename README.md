## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bocaletto-luca/PolyglotPal.git
   cd PolyglotPal
   ```

2. **Serve the app locally**  
   Modern browsers block `fetch()` on `file://`, so you must use a simple HTTP server:

   - **Python 3**  
     ```bash
     python3 -m http.server 8000
     ```
   - **Node.js (http-server)**  
     ```bash
     npx http-server . -p 8000
     ```
   - **Ruby**  
     ```bash
     ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8000
     ```

3. **Open in browser**  
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.
